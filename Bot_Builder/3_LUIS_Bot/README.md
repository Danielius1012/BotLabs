# LUIS Bot - Bot Builder

In this lab, we will create a bot that can learn and take over the world - more or less. What it can do though, is using the Machine Learning capabilities of the [LUIS Service](http://luis.ai) to learn phrases from the user and extract his/her intentions and entities used in the phrase. We will train it to be able to tell us the weather in any given city, using the API form [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/).

We will not cover how to publish or register your bot. To learn more about publishing and registration, take a look at the [Basic Echo Bot](https://github.com/Danielius1012/BotLabs/tree/master/Bot_Builder/1_Basic_Echo_Bot).
